# TransitRouter.jl

Transit routing in Julia. For now, using the [RAPTOR](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/156567/raptor_alenex.pdf) algorithm (Delling, Pajor, and Werneck, 2012), though other algorithms could be added in the future. Users using pre-0.0.2 versions should upgrade, as 0.0.2 fixes a significant bug in the RAPTOR implementation where trips with more transfers were preferred over those with fewer (even if they were longer in time).

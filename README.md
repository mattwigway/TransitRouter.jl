# TransitRouter.jl

Experimental transit routing in Julia. For now, using the [RAPTOR](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/156567/raptor_alenex.pdf) algorithm, though other algorithms could be added in the future. Very much thrown together to meet a deadline, but better comments/documentation are planned.

## Usage

### Build a network

From the command line:

    julia build_network.jl out_network.trjl in_gtfs [in_gtfs...]

From Julia:

```julia
network::TransitNetwork = build_network(gtfs_file...)

# save the network for later use
save_network(network, filename)
```

### Route

```julia
network::TransitNetwork = load_network(network_filename)

raptor_reqest = RaptorRequest(
    # These are stops where you could board transit, and what time you could board there. Multiple can be specified,
    # for instance if an external street router were used to get the travel times to a number of nearby stops
    # stop_idx is a numerical index. It can be retrieved from stop IDs using network.stopidx_for_id["filename:stop_id"]
    # note that stop_ids are prefixed with the path of the GTFS file they came from, as specified on the command line
    # or in the arguments to build_network
    [
        StopAndTime(stop_idx::Int64, time_seconds_since_midnight::Int32),
        ...
    ],
    4, # maximum number of rides, e.g. 4 = max 3 transfers
    Date("2021-04-13", "yyyy-mm-dd"), # date of search
    1.33 # walk speed in meters per second
)

raptor_result = raptor(network, raptor_request)
```

`raptor_result` has a number of arrays. The interesting one is `times_at_stops_each_round`; each row represents the result of a RAPTOR round, with the fastest travel time to that stop found in that round (or before that round). It is longer than the number of rounds, because Round 1 is considered the street search and is initialized based on the request, and then each RAPTOR round results in two rowsâ€”one for stops reached via transit, and then an additional "transfers" round.
